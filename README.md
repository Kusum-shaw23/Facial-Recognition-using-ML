👤 Face Recognition using Machine Learning

A machine learning–based system for detecting and recognizing faces in images. Trained on a Kaggle facial dataset, the model uses feature extraction and classification techniques to achieve high recognition accuracy.

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, dlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN)

Techniques: PCA, CNN embeddings, SVM, KNN

Deployment: Local execution (can be extended to cloud/web)

📁 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Face Dataset

Description: Labeled facial images, each representing a unique person.

Note: Due to Kaggle’s terms, download the dataset manually and place it in the /dataset folder.

🧠 Model Overview
